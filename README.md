# Squee
Simple timetracker made in JS and Python. Made mostly for personal use, but you're free to test it out if curious. Everything is saved on disk as CSV so you can use it in other places it is saved across refreshes.

> Controls: Add items to your day using the form at the top; Double click on items to edit them (leave the "name" field blank to delete); right click on the titles of days to see some more data.

To use, run `python3 src/app.py` then access at `127.0.0.1:8000`
